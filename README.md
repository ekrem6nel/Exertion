# Exertion
Modern Java Web Application Framework for the Cloud

Exertion is a web application framework stripped down to its bare minimals. It is devised to be optimal for cloud usage.
Hence, it doesn't have any of the bulky libraries or dependencies. Basically, it is a single jar performing tasks
such as dependency injection, testing, mocking, serving/calling rest endpoints, serving static content (such as HTML, JavaScript, etc )
and providing facilities to promoto modern best practices in software development.

Its primary intended target is microservices in a containerized cloud environment. Since we promised it to be a single jar dependency,
it has helper modules to be able to work with external tools such as NoSQL databases and message queues. Also it needs extra modules
to be able to integrate nicely with industry standard frameworks and tools.
